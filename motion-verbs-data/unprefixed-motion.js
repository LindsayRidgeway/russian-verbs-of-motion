One more thing. I don't know if you're aware of this, but your platform limits the size of a file that you can send me, and it offers a "continue" feature when a file is too big that I have found sometimes results in corrupted files.

Therefore, although it will be tedious, I'd like to ask you to send only one file per message. When I receive it, I'll paste it into my directory and then send another message so that you can respond with the next file.

I don't care what order you send the files to me. I'm ready for the first one. Thanks!
